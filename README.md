## 🏆 Algorithms  
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas used to solve problems efficiently. They help in sorting data, searching for information, optimizing solutions, and even training AI models!  

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms  
Algorithms designed to **find** an element in a dataset (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).  

### 💲 Sorting Algorithms  
Algorithms that **arrange** elements in a specific order (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort).  

### 🔄 Recursive & Divide & Conquer Algorithms  
Techniques that break a problem into **smaller subproblems** and solve them recursively (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).  

### 💰 Greedy Algorithms  
Algorithms that make the **best immediate choice** at each step to reach an optimal solution (e.g., Huffman Coding, Kruskal's Algorithm).  

### 🧠 Dynamic Programming Algorithms  
A method that **stores past results** to avoid redundant calculations, making problem-solving more efficient (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem).  

### 🌉 Kruskal's Algorithm  
A **graph algorithm** used to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**, helping to connect all points with the shortest path possible.  

### 🚗 Dijkstra's Algorithm  
A **shortest path algorithm** that finds the fastest route between nodes, used in navigation systems like Google Maps.  

### 🔁 Back Propagation Algorithm  
An algorithm used in **training neural networks**, helping AI models learn by adjusting weights based on errors.

## 📊 Asymptotic Analysis  
Asymptotic analysis helps us **measure how fast an algorithm runs** as the input size grows. It's crucial for understanding **efficiency and scalability**.  

### 🔹 Big-O Notation (**O(f(n))**)  
Describes the **worst-case** performance of an algorithm, showing how execution time increases as the dataset grows.  

### 🔸 Omega Notation (**Ω(f(n))**)  
Describes the **best-case** performance, representing the fastest an algorithm can run.

## 🏗️ Data Structures  
Data structures are ways to **organize and store data** efficiently for quick access and modifications.  

### 🐛 Linked Lists  
A **chain of nodes** where each node stores data and a reference to the next. Unlike arrays, they allow efficient insertions and deletions.  

### 🔄 Doubly Linked Lists  
A **linked list** where each node points to both its **previous and next** node, allowing easier traversal.  

### 📧 Queues  
A **FIFO (First In, First Out)** structure, like a line at a store (e.g., used in job scheduling, task management).  

### 🎟️ Priority Queues  
A queue where each element has a **priority**, and higher-priority elements are served first (e.g., airline boarding system).  

### 📂 Stack  
A **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** structure, like a stack of plates (e.g., used in function calls, undo operations).  

### 🔺 Heap  
A **tree-based** structure used in priority queues and sorting algorithms.  

### 🌲 Binary Search Trees (BST)  
A **tree** where each node has at most **two children**, with left children smaller and right children larger, enabling efficient searching.  

### 🌿 AVL Trees  
A **self-balancing BST** where heights of left and right subtrees are always balanced.  

### 🗂 B-Trees  
A **generalized BST** optimized for fast searches, especially in databases and file systems.  

### 🗃 B*-Trees  
An improved version of **B-Trees**, with more balanced storage, reducing search time in large-scale applications.
